### Key Features
C# is a multi-paradigm language that supports various programming styles, including structured, imperative, object-oriented, event-driven, task-driven, functional, generic, reflective, and concurrent programming. This flexibility makes C# suitable for a wide range of applications, including:

- __Mobile applications__: C# can be used to develop apps for iOS and Android using frameworks like Xamarin.

- __Desktop applications__: It is commonly used for building Windows applications.

- __Web applications and services__: C# is widely used for developing web applications and services using ASP.NET.

- __Games__: C# is the primary language for Unity, a popular game development engine.

- __VR applications__: C# is also used in virtual reality development.

- __Database applications__: It is used for creating applications that interact with databases.

### Getting Started
To run these projects, you can simply use the Python code from each folder and run it on any IDE you prefer.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git

2. Navigate to any C# folders, for example:

   ```bash
   cd your-repository-name/01_hello_world/Program.cs

3. Open the terminal in Visual Studio by pressing Ctrl+ (backtick) and run the following command to compile your code:

   ```bash
   cd C:\Path\To\YourProject
